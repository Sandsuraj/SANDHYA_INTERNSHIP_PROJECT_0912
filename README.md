📌 Overview
This project is an AI-based system that automatically converts podcast audio into text and segments long conversations into meaningful topic-wise sections. It combines Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to improve accessibility, navigation, and analysis of long-form podcast content.

🚀 Features
Automatic speech-to-text transcription of podcast audio
Topic segmentation using semantic similarity analysis
Handles long-duration podcast episodes

🧠 System Workflow Podcast audio is uploaded by the user
Audio preprocessing is performed to improve quality
Speech-to-text model generates the transcript
NLP techniques analyze the transcript
Topic boundaries are detected and segmented

🛠️ Technologies
Used Python Whisper (Automatic Speech Recognition) Sentence Transformers Natural Language Processing (NLP) Google Colab
